    This program calculates the volume of a cylinder and then calculates the side length of a cube with the same volume.
    The program prompts the user to enter the radius and height of the cylinder, and then it computes the volume using the formula:
    Volume = Ï€ * r^2 * h
    where r is the radius and h is the height.
    After calculating the volume, it computes the side length of a cube with that volume using the formula:
    Side length = (Volume)^(1/3)
    Finally, it prints out the side length of the cube.
